			<h1>MyBB Support Guidelines</h1>
			<p>Some ground rules for when you're helping MyBB users</p>
		</header>
		<p>When you're helping other MyBB users with their issues, it is important to remember that you only respond <strong>if you are comfortable and knowledgable in the topic the user needs help with</strong>. If you don't know how to help, it's better to leave the issue for someone who knows an answer than make a guess.</p>
		<p>Beyond that, there are some basic guidelines to keep in mind while providing support to users:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Be nice.</strong> Many users looking for support are new to MyBB. There's never a good reason to be rude or condescending, even if a user doesn't understand the help you're giving.</li>
			<li><strong>Use proper English.</strong> It's important to be clear and concise when providing support. Also, remember that while not all of our users speak English, support provided on the <a href="http://community.mybb.com">Community Forums</a> is provided in English only.</li>
			<li><strong>Don't ask for sensitive information, such as administrative credentials.</strong> For the safety of other users, only MyBB staff members should be trusted with sensitive information.</li>
			<li><strong>Give support to help, not for reputation.</strong> While getting a positive rating for a post is a nice reward for helping users, you should not expect anything for giving support. Do not get upset if your reputation doesn't get a boost every time you provide support.</li>
		</ul>
