# Latest version information
## Guarantee of latest updates

Make sure to obtain the software packages from official sources. The [Download page]({{ site.url }}/download/) always shows the most recent available version and the [MyBB Blog](https://blog.mybb.com) contains official announcements related to the Project.

You can get notified of updates by:
 - subscribing to the [MyBB Blog](https://blog.mybb.com),
 - following [@mybb on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mybb),
 - following [@mybbsecurity on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mybbsecurity) (security-related releases).

# Checksums
## Integrity of downloaded packages

_Checksums are short chunks of text which can verify that files were downloaded correctly. MyBB publishes checksums generated by `SHA-512`, `SHA-256`, `SHA-1` and `MD5` hash algorithms (strongest to weakest &mdash; checking `SHA-512` is recommended)._

After downloading the package, its checksum should be compared to the one that was published.

- **Linux** &mdash; Terminal

  ```
  sha512sum filename.zip
  ```

- **Mac OS X** &mdash; Terminal

  ```
  shasum --algorithm 512 filename.zip
  ```

- **Windows** &mdash; Command Prompt

  ```
  CertUtil -hashfile filename.zip SHA512
  ```

- **Windows** &mdash; PowerShell

  ```
  Get-FileHash filename.zip -Algorithm SHA512 | Format-List
  ```

# Signatures
## Integrity &amp; Authenticity of downloaded packages

_Digital signatures, when checked against public keys, show whether certain data was signed using private keys owned by developers, thus allowing to verify the authenticity of published packages. Make sure your system has [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/download/index.html) installed (version 2.1 or higher is recommended) to be able to use the commands below._

1. **Fetch the list of public keys** used to sign official releases from `https://mybb.com/download/keys/raw` and import them:

   ```
   gpg --import KEYS
   ```

2. **Verify the signature** of the downloaded file:

   - `gpg --verify filename.zip.asc`

   	 where _filename.zip.asc_ is a file containing signatures for _filename.zip_.

   - Alternatively, you can use

     ```
     gpg --verify - filename.zip
     ```

     to have GnuPG check the signature of _filename.zip_ that will be pasted into the Terminal/Command Prompt (_stdin_).

     Once pasted, press **Ctrl + D** (`^D`) and **Enter** on Linux, or **Ctrl + Z** (`^Z`) and **Enter** on Windows.

### Key verification
All code signing keys are maintained in accordance with the Project's [**Package Signing Protocol**]({{ site.url }}/download/keys/protocol):
 - signatures from keys listed on [mybb.com/download/keys/](https://mybb.com/download/keys/):
   - with `CODE SIGNING KEY` as the key's comment,
   - active and belonging to Team members at the time of release,
 - each key must have a corresponding _`ADDING...`_ announcement with its fingerprint and owner's username on [twitter.com/mybbsecurity](https://twitter.com/mybbsecurity),
 - each key must **not** have a corresponding _`REMOVING...`_ announcement with its fingerprint on [twitter.com/mybbsecurity](https://twitter.com/mybbsecurity),
 - each key must have been added at least 14 days before it was used for signing,
 - each key must be signed by its owner with a key listed on [mybb.com/about/team/](https://mybb.com/about/team/),
 - each key must be signed by a current member of the Management Team or a current team Leader, other than the key's owner, listed on [mybb.com/about/team/](https://mybb.com/about/team/).

 Note that the [keys file](https://mybb.com/download/keys/raw.txt) is updated with revoked signatures whenever keys are removed.
