			<h1>Minimum Copyright</h1>
		</header>
		<p>
			MyBB is licenced under the LGPL and therefore users may remove the MyBB copyright and credit notice from the footer of their forum, however those who choose to do so are ineligible for support on the community forums.
		</p>
		<p>
			To receive support users must display at the very least the following "powered by" notice on every page of their forum:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			Powered by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="{{ site.safebaseurl }}">MyBB</a>.
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			The text must contain a link to <a rel="nofollow" href="{{ site.safebaseurl }}">{{ site.safebaseurl }}</a>, an image of the text is acceptable however it must still link to <a rel="nofollow" href="{{ site.safebaseurl }}">{{ site.safebaseurl }}</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			If your theme does not already carry the powered by message it can be added by going into your admin control panel &gt; Templates &amp; Styles &gt; Templates &gt; *Select template* &gt; Footer templates &gt; Footer and then adding the following code:
		</p>
			<pre>Powered by &lt;a href=&quot;{{ site.safebaseurl }}&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MyBB&lt;/a&gt;.</pre>
		<p>
			Users that are found to violate this rule will be denied support temporarily (for the first offense) until rectified, or permanently for repeated offenders.
		</p>

			<h1>Appropriateness of Content</h1>
		</header>
		<p>
			For ethical and legal reasons the MyBB Group also chooses not to provide support to websites containing any of the following:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Hacking (includes "leaks")</li>
			<li>Pornography</li>
			<li>Illegal file distribution or piracy</li>
			<li>Illegal use of electronic assets, including but not limited to violation of theme licensing (e.g. removing author name from footer)</li>
			<li>Any other forms of illegal activity</li>
			<li>Racist or hateful content</li>
			<li>Discussions that encourage, promote or demonstrate methods of producing, consuming, using, cultivating, buying, selling, distributing or supplying drugs that could reasonably be considered illegal</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Users known to operate a website which contains any of the above will be noted by staff and they will be denied support in all future instances, regardless of whether the support is intended for another acceptable site operated by the user. This is because otherwise MyBB staff can not be certain if their support is benefiting an acceptable site or one that is not.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note: The MyBB Group doesn't classify game or console modding as hacking, providing it is not used for malicious purposes.
		</p>

		<header>
			<h1>Other instances</h1>
		</header>
		<p>
			The MyBB Group reserves the right to deny support to any member in any case they feel it is an appropriate consequence to other rule violations committed by the user. Examples of this might be abuse towards staff or members in a support threads, or if the user repeatedly sends mass private messages to staff for support.</p>

		<header>
			<h1>I have been denied support, what now?</h1>
		</header>
		<p>
			The MyBB Community Forums are not the only source of support available for MyBB. You may be able to find an answer to your problem on the <a href="https://docs.mybb.com/">Docs site</a> or on another unofficial MyBB resource website.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you believe your support denial was unjustified, or you have rectified the issue that resulted in the denial, you may discuss the matter in the <a href="https://community.mybb.com/forum-135.html" title="Private Inquiries" target="_blank">Private Inquiries</a>, which may include removal of the support denial, at the sole judgment of the MyBB Group.
