			<h1>About the MyBB Project</h1>
			<p>MyBB is a mature forum software platform developed by the MyBB Group</p>
		</header>
		<p>
			Years ago, Chris Boulton, web34rk, and b0ndman were on a team developing the XMB forum software. After some time, web34rk and b0ndman left the team and Chris became lead developer of a team with two other developers. Over time, staff shifted again and several developers didn't like the way things were heading and left the team, together forking the project as DevBB. &nbsp;DevBB was the predecessor to MyBB, a temporary solution for people to use whilst MyBB was being developed from scratch.</p>
		<p>
			MyBB 1.0 was released to the public on December 9, 2005 after several years of steady development and testing. In the years since, MyBB has undergone active development, further extending MyBB's capabilities through new features and the capabilities of third-party developers with improved plugin support. Today, MyBB is a mature forum software with a wide range of useful <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/features">features</a>.</p>
		<p>
			Soon, the MyBB team will begin development on MyBB 2.0, a complete rewrite of the software. While the MyBB team is responsible for planning MyBB's future, MyBB also relies on the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/get-involved">involvement</a> of its community to execute this vision by contributing in development, testing, support, or resources.</p>

			Members of the MyBB Group, often referred to as the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about/team">MyBB team</a>, are volunteers committed to developing, supporting, and managing the MyBB forum software project. As an open source project, the MyBB team is pushing to open up its development process as much as possible to make it easier for community members to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/get-involved">get involved</a> with the project. Community members actively contributing to the MyBB project are recruited to join the team in an official capacity.</p>
