<p>
	MyBB's reputation system lets users rate other users based on their actions and posts. All ratings are tallied to give every user a total reputation, which can be displayed in their profiles and posts. To help limit abuse, all reputation comments are public, displayed in a simple reputation report along with the comment and value of the rating.</p>

<h2>
	Rate users multiple times</h2>
<p>
	Ever since it was introduced, MyBB's reputation system has offered the ability to give individual a negative, neutral, or positive rating, as well as leave a comment to explain the rating. But these ratings could only be given once. Since MyBB 1.6, it is possible to rate a single user multiple times, leaving a number of comments on their reputation report. It is also possible to remove the ability to add positive, neutral, or negative reputation points.</p>

<h2>
	Rate posts, too</h2>
<p>
	MyBB 1.6 introduced the ability to rate not just users, but individual posts as well. Every post can be given a rating (negative, neutral, or positive) to be left on the users' reputation report, allowing users to show they approve - or disapprove - of another's posts. For post ratings, leaving a comment is optional.</p>
